## 1-D steady Convection Diffusion problem
A 1D steady state convection diffusion was solved by various numerical methods. 
<br> ![Alt-txt](https://github.com/devanshuThakar/Computational-Fluid-Dynamics/blob/main/Project-1/Images/1D-equn.jpg) </br>
The solution was compared with uniform grids by changing number of nodes and the Peclet number, Pe. The equation was even solved by using a non-unifrom grid. 

Two plots computed with a uniform grid of 11 nodes for Pe=50 and Pe=18 are shown.
