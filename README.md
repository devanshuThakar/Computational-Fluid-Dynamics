# Computational-Fluid-Dynamics
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of popular numerical methods in Computation Fluid dynamics.  Starting from simple methods like Gauss Elimination, ADI method to advance methods like Rhie-chow interpolation, SIMPLE are implemented. This was done as a part of the CFD course offered at IIT Gandhinagar 2021.
