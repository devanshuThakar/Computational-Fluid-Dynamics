# Computational-Fluid-Dynamics
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of popular numerical methods in Computational Fluid dynamics.  Starting from simple methods like Gauss Elimination, ADI method to advance methods like Rhie-chow interpolation, SIMPLE-scheme for solving Navier Stokes equation are implemented. This was done as a part of the CFD course offered at IIT Gandhinagar 2021.

The contents of the folders in this repository are summarized as follows.

* <b> 2D-Heat Transfer </b><br>
In this project, the unsteady 2D heat conduction equation is solved using explicit and Alternating Direction Implicit scheme. 

* <b> Project-1 </b><br>
A 1D convection diffusion problem is solved using Finite Difference(FD) methods. Solutions were compared for different values of Peclet number.

* <b> Project-2 </b><br>
A 2D convection diffusion eqution with a given source term and Dirichlet boundary conditions is solved using Finite Difference(FD) schemes. 

* <b> Project-3 </b><br>
A 2D scalar transport equation for the transport of a scalr quatity is solved using Finite Volume (FV) apporach. 

* <b> Lid-driven-cavity </b><br>
The standard problem of lid-driven-cavity flow is solved using Finite Volume (FV) approches like (Quassi) Rhie-chow interpolation and SIMPLE methods.
